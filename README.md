# VersusSort
Script to help create ranked lists from unsorted lists of arbitrary things based on user input.

## Idea
This project is inspired by [charasort](https://github.com/execfera/charasort), though it borrows no code. This implementation is basically a manual adaptation of the binary search algorithm.

## Instructions
1. Make a text file with a song name - or anything else to rank - on each line and place in in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script and follow the prompts.
